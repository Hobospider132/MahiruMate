# Where's Mahiru?
I'm still waiting on the animations so in the meantime, I've included an image of Indi's balls instead.

# What does it do currently?
- Can play pong

# What are the plans for the future?
The future plans include:
- Further dialogue
- Proper animations for idling, walking and dragging
- Menu optimisation

Open to suggestions as well so please message me ideas. I will consider them all.

# I love Indi's balls. What will happen to his balls after animations are made?
Don't worry, I will be releasing an alternative version of each release where Indi's balls will be the pet.
However, there will be ***NO*** animations for that version, it will ***PURELY*** be the same image seen
in these beta releases

# Demo:

Main features showcase: <video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8f586fb-70a9-4562-9656-c658dd4d5ed3"></video>

Movement showcase: <video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7abdf991-2c8d-437d-9a51-1a54bfcf6564"></video>

More features are inside, not everything has been included in the demo. Demo is also based on the first beta release.
I have not been bothered to record further videos. This is just to give a general idea of what to expect
